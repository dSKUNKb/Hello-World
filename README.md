# Hello-World
### My History In Homebrew and Dev Spaces
# My Humble Beginnings
#### Where it all began..
It all started in 2006 with the Original Xbox. I have been engaged in homebrew spaces since I was about 11 years old. I was on a construction job with my father and his client who at the time worked at EA Games, when he saw my interest in his modified Original Xbox Console. 
This thing could take rented games from Blockbuster (wow its been awhile) and rip them from the DVD directly to the hard drive. 
As soon as I realized the possabilities of modifying and homebrew I was hooked. I felt the freedom and couldnt stop! 
I started to research the different methods for modifying my Xbox. 
After hyperfixating on that for awhile I finally got the xbox to work. After hours of tinkering I was able to modify the software to run homebrew developed code.
I rented and ripped as many games as I could! As time went on I found ways to emulate older consoles and familiarized myself with FTP (File Transfer Protocol) so I could keep the console up to date with the most recent homebrew developments.
#### As Time Progressed..
My interests changed and so did the technology. When the Xbox 360 had come out I was already avid with following tutorials and tinkering around on my own due to my research and familiarity with the Original Xbox.
Fast forward a few years to around 2007 and before I knew it I was ripping into the Xbox 360 to see what I could do. Turns out, with a little finesse and research you are able to flash the firmware of the X360's DVD-Drive in order to bypass the encryption and security checks that see if the DVD-ROM is legitimate or not. 
I kept playing around in these games and stumbled upon other content creator communities on the PC. This is when I encountered Garry's Mod. 
A creative sandbox game that was made running on the Source Engine, which is the same engine which runs well known popular games such as Half Life 2 or Team Fortress 2.
I didn't have a PC that could handle these games at the time so I had to make due. I kept playing the X360 and eventually received Team Fortress 2 for the console.
This game runs on the same engine whether on PC or Console so in theory I was able to transfer the gamepad controller's "Config.cfg" file to my PC then edit it in and put it back on the console in order to change the keybinds and make my own Modmenu for the game on console. I then realized I can create "Alias" for the Modmenu.
This allowed me to press and hold a button (i.e. down on the d-pad) and the code I wrote would then change the entire controller layout to a separate modmenu or "Alias" I designed in order to retain the original functionality of the controller when the button was released.
#### Beginnings of Something New.. 
I continued with this until I was about 15 years old and worked my way toward PC gaming and building myself a nice gaming/workstation Rig.
My Grandfather had seen my passion for computers when I was around 12 or 13 and bought me a basic Emachines desktop for personal use (God time flies!).
After familiarizing myself heavily with PC I wanted to try to upgrade my basic desktop. Fast forward a few months and a client of my fathers said I could have an entire lot of some odd 30+ desktop computers. Prior to ripping into my own, after taking these 30+ PC's home I tore into them to see what was on the inside.
Out of the 30 or so computers were ripped apart I then catalougued all the parts. I had multiple SATA Hard Drives, Sata Cables, Old Processors etc. of which very little I was actually able to use. I found a CPU which was a little newer than my current one. From memory it was a dual core Intel CPU but had 2 cores locked and turned off. Which they sometimes do in order to meet demands if they have more than enough multi-core CPU's but not enough lower count core CPU's to meet demand. They will lock 2 cores and hide them form use. Sometimes manufacturers will also do so if some cores are unstable in order to still be able to sell the CPU as a lesser core model. 
With a little tinkering and the realization that one of these desktops had an aftermarket motherboard I was able to pop the new (to me) CPU into the aftermarket motherboard and unlock and "turn on" those hidden cores. Effectivley turning a dual core into a quad core.
After running some stability tests overnight and determining if the new setup was stable I was able to increase my PC's processing speed and core count! Sadly this was only a temporary upgrade and didnt allow me to persue any PC gaming as it wasnt enough of an upgrade to do so.
I studied hard to get out of high school early and graduated in 2011. One of my rewards from my parents for studying and getting out early was giving me a budget to create and build my own custom PC.
With this new PC I've gotten heavily into PC gaming and been able to expand my homebrewing capabilities.
#### Advancing My Knowledge..
So it's 2021 now in this timeline and I've continued in my efforts of expanding my know-how. Since then, I've gotten into 3D-Printing and design as a COVID hobby and gained some familiarity with gcode (The code that both 3D-Printers and CNC Machines use) to allow me to edit what my 3D printer does both before and after prints. I've familiarized myself with both Delta and Cartesian 3D Printers.
